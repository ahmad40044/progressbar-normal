first i setup html with 1,2,3,4 and next prev buttons

on top link css
on body botton import script src 

then applied styles of normal levels

then after that the remaining effects were made using vanilla js 

where there was  active 

then ative shifting to the other  and highlighting multiple  so active was added to all 

then there was progress bar  with click as well 

that is it
